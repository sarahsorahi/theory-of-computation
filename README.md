# Introduction to the Theory of Computation

This repository contains teaching and learning materials for the course  
**Introduction to the Theory of Computation**.

It introduces the mathematical foundations of computation through
formal languages, automata, and computability theory. It is primarily based on:

> Michael Sipser, *Introduction to the Theory of Computation*, 2nd Edition

The course follows the progression of the Chomsky Hierarchy, moving from
finite automata and regular languages to context-free languages, Turing machines,
and the limits of computation.
